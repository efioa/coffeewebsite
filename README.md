# coffeewebsite
This is my second project with the ucd Professional Academy Full-Stack Software Development Course. We were instructed to build a website from 
scratch using what we have learned so far in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
This website is focused around sourcing coffee beans from all over the world. It gives the user a chance to email us to ask about anything 
in regards to the coffee we have available to sell and also maybe a little information for us as they have a feedback option in the review section. 
I do intend to finish the project once we learn a few more languages for back-end coding hence why there in no 'cart' page for this website.
